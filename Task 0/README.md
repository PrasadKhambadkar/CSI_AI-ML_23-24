Task 0/a: Text Summarization with Transformer Models

Description:

In this task, the candidate will work with transformer models to perform text summarization.
They will use a pre-trained transformer model to generate an abstractive summary of a given
long article or blog post. The goal is to learn how to use a transformer library, load the
model, and generate concise summaries.


Specific Steps/Features:
1. Familiarise themselves with the concept of transformer models and text summarization.
2. Choose a pre-trained transformer model for the task.
3. Load the pre-trained model using a transformer library (e.g., Hugging Face's
Transformers).
4. Preprocess the input long article and tokenize it for the model.
5. Generate an abstractive summary using the loaded transformer model.
6. Evaluate and refine the generated summary for coherence and relevance.

Task 0/b : Decision Tree for Iris Flower Classification

Description:
In this task, the candidate will work with decision trees for classification. They will implement
a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn to classify Iris flowers into different species based
on their features. The candidate's goal is to visualise the resulting decision tree and its
decision boundaries.


Specific Steps/Features:
1. Understand the concept of decision trees and their application in classification.
2. Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn's datasets module or link for the dataset in
resources.
3. Preprocess the dataset by splitting it into features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length,
petal width) and target (species).
4. Train a decision tree classifier on the dataset.
5. Visualise the resulting decision tree using visualisation(eg. graphviz).
6. Interpret the decision boundaries and node splits in the decision tree.
